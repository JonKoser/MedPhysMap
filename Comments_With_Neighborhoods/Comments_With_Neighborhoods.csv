Having lived all around Madison in the dumpiest houses and shared bedrooms/apartments with strangers and best firends, I've come to value a clean place with reliable heat/AC, management, and convenience.","Regardless of what anyone from out of state says, downtown Madison is ridiculously expensive for Wisconsin. Most of my friends have roommates or live in a shared bedroom with a significant other to cut down on rent costs. I've never had a car here and found its very manageable to live without one, so if you can do this, it will save tons of money that could go towards living closer to WIMR or in a nicer place. First year, I highly recommend living close to downtown so that you can experience nightlife - It was the best year ever and wouldn't change it for the world.","44"
